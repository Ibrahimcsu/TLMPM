# TLMPM

This repository provides a robust implementation of a simple vectorized Total Lagrangian Material Point Method (TLMPM) for simulating dynamic response and vibration in continua. The code is designed to handle large deformations and complex geometries efficiently.

In addition to TLMPM, the repository also includes implementations of MUSL MPM, CPDI MPM, and B-Spline MPM, enabling comparative studies across multiple MPM formulations.
